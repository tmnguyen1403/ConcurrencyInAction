## Explanation from ChatGPT
std::promise is a class template provided by the C++ Standard Library that allows you to store a value or an exception to be retrieved asynchronously at a later time. It is typically used in combination with a std::future object, which provides a mechanism for retrieving the stored value or exception.

std::promise is often used to pass data or exceptions between threads or between different contexts, as it allows you to set the value or exception from one context and retrieve it from another.

Here is an example of how to use std::promise to pass a value between two threads:

```
#include <future>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void SetValue(std::promise<int>& p) {
  p.set_value(42);  // Set the value of the promise
}

int main() {
  std::promise<int> p;
  std::future<int> f = p.get_future();  // Get a future to retrieve the value of the promise

  std::thread t(SetValue, std::ref(p));  // Launch a new thread to set the value of the promise

  std::cout << f.get() << std::endl;  // Outputs "42"

  t.join();

  return 0;
}

```
In this example, the SetValue function sets the value of the std::promise object p to 42. The std::promise object is passed to the SetValue function by reference using std::ref.

The main thread retrieves a std::future object f from the std::promise object using the get_future function. The std::future object can then be used to retrieve the value of the std::promise object once it has been set.

The main thread then launches a new thread t that executes the SetValue function, which sets the value of the std::promise object to 42. The main thread waits for the value to be set by calling the f.get() function, which blocks until the value is available.

I hope this helps clarify the use of std::promise in C++. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
